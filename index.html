      <h1> 
        Rankings of Various Media
      </h1>
    <p>
        On this site I will be discussing and laying out rankings for my all-time favourites from different types of media. Examples include anime, video games, and musical albums. Throughout each list I will be explaining my reasoning behind each rank, my personal thoughts on them, and their main themes presented in the media.

        Background Information
    </h2>
    <p>
        Personally I have been invested in things such as music and shows since I was only a few months old. I've sat in front of the TV for hours and hours on end before I could even walk.

    <p>
        Music is something that I was introduced to by my family when I was extremely young. Anime was something I personally stumbled upon while I was browsing the library for some animated movies. While I was a little late to start playing Video Games, analyzing the technical side and just them overall has been something I've enjoyed since the beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
        Over time I fell in love with looking deeper at these things and picking them apart. This led me to enjoy them even more after learning more about their underlying themes and just how great they were in their respective genres/industries.
