<h1>
    Rankings of Various Media
</h1>
<p>
    On this site I will be discussing and laying out rankings for my all-time favourites from different types of media. Examples include anime, video games, and musical albums. Throughout each list I will be explaining my reasoning behind each rank, my personal
    thoughts on them, and their main themes presented in the media.

    <h2>
        Background Information
    </h2>
    <p>
        Personally I have been invested in things such as music and shows since I was only a few months old. I've sat in front of the TV for hours and hours on end before I could even walk.
    </p>
    <p>
        Music is something that I was introduced to by my family when I was extremely young. Anime was something I personally stumbled upon while I was browsing the library for some animated movies. While I was a little late to start playing Video Games, analyzing
        the technical side and just them overall has been something I've enjoyed since the beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
        Over time I fell in love with looking deeper at these things and picking them apart. This led me to enjoy them even more after learning more about their underlying themes and just how great they were in their respective genres/industries.

<div class="Anime">
    <h2>
        Taste in Anime
    </h2>
    <p>
        Anime is a medium that I have indulged in since I was around 8-9 years old. I’ve watched a lot of different anime over the years and read quite a bit of their source material, such as manga and novels. I typically enjoy psychological and drama based shows
        in general so that didn’t change much when I started watching anime. It’s quite apparent in my top 3 that they are all shows that contain deeper psychological meanings that the author intended to be received while watching/reading their works.
    </p>
    <p>
        All the anime on the list usually have that genre in common, along with the fact that they have great soundtracks and top tier writing. I’ve always enjoyed reading and high class writing, along with great music, so those were a couple things that leaked
        into that form of entertainment for me. Some of my favourite authors have even been ones that have made anime. People such as Nisio Isin and Chico Umino are some of my favourite authors of all time, with most of their works being all hits
        in my book and they’ve presented messages that resonate with me to this day.

<div class="Music">
    <h2>
        Taste in Music
    </h2>
    <p>
        Music is something that I personally cannot even trace back to an exact point in life. It’s been something that I constantly listen to all the time and every day. It helps me stay calm and also gives me some energy to make it through the day. The genre’s
        I listen to are all over the place. I listen to things such as pop rock, hip-hop, alternative pop, and indie. Those are more of the mainstream genres that I listen to on a daily basis. Examples of more interesting genres are ones such as alternative
        hip-hop, indie classical, folk pop, and overall ambient music. The languages could range from English, Japanese, Korean, Chinese and Spanish.

    </p>
    <p>
        Even though all the genres are all over the place, they all have one thing in common, writing. Most of the music I listen to and enjoy the most are the ones with in-depth writing that don’t hinder the actual listening experience. I enjoy listening to
        songs with great production and instrumental but lyrics definitely are a big factor for me. There are some albums I listen to that actually have 0 lyrics at all, but they make up for it by presenting instrumentals that still resonate and send
        a message without even the need for words.

<div class="VideoGames">
    <h2>
        Taste in Video Games
    </h2>
    <p>
        While video games aren't something I play too often, when I do, they’re amazing. I remember playing on an old NES that my godmother had ever since I was around 8-9 years old. A big motivation for me to play these games was their stories. It felt like
        I was playing through a cinematic experience where I had my own input in them. While I of course did enjoy playing multiplayer games that included actions and sports, my favourite games of all time were the ones that had the best story and
        enjoyment from me. They also were pretty revolutionary games in their respective genres.

    </p>
    <p>
        I would still say my favourite genres are RPGs and choice-based games. I’ve played through most of the pokemon games through emulators and I enjoyed most, if not all of them. While those games typically have a large amount of hours you need to play through,
        if they are able to capture my attention for that long, they are truly great. I played a lot of game back when I had more time and less responsibilities but some of these games are still ones I look back and have fond memories of.
