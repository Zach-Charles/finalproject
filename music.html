            Music Rankings
        </h1>
    </div>
    <p> On this page I’ll be discussing my favourite albums of all-time. This won’t include any mixtapes or EP’s since they technically aren’t albums. I've always enjoyed listening to a wide variety of music from all different genres and languages. Music
        has always been a universal enjoyment no matter where I am or what I’m listening to. As long as I enjoy it and like what I’m listening to, it’s considered good in my eyes. While there are a lot of albums I enjoy, I sadly had to narrow my favourites
        down to just around four.

    </p>
    <p>Like before, I’ll be ranking these based on multiple categories. I’ll give a score for Production, Lyrics, and Enjoyment. Since this is music there isn’t too much that I go in-depth about for categories but I’ll be explaining a lot in the paragraphs.
        I’ll have a top 3 and then one honorable mention that won’t be scored at all. Even though I enjoy a lot of instrumentals, classical and electronic music, I’ll avoid ranking those and focus on stuff with actual lyrics and such. It’ll be out
        of 100.
    </p>

        <p>This is one of my favourite alternative rock albums of all-time. It is essentially 11 straight songs of great tracks that all have great instrumentals. It features some of my favourite songs in general such as “Golden Days” and “Crazy=Genius”.
            The overall theme of the album is reflecting on the band’s frontrunner’s upcoming wedding. He is reflecting on life before he is ultimately changed into a married man. This messaging is quite obvious in tracks such as “House of Memories”,
            “Death of a Bachelor” and “Golden Days”. While some songs tend to go off track they are still great standalone singles.

        <p>This is a 15-track album from the well-known J-pop artist Kenshi Yonezu. While it came out in 2020 fully, singles have been released in anticipation for it since 2018. The first single off this album, Lemon, is what really propelled him into
            the limelight and top of a few Japanese charts. This album is nothing too groundbreaking in terms of genre, being a Japanese Pop album with clear influence of rock in it. The reason why it is so good in my opinion is that every song from
            the ground up has Kenshi’s work in it. He writes it, produces it, sings it and plays most of the instrumentals for it.
        </p>
        <p>The title of the album is referring to the Parable of the Lost Sheep in the bible. In the Parable, they say the lost sheep is a sinner and that although they have strayed away from the path of God, they can come into his kingdom. This album
            is quite the opposite, Kenshi knows that he cannot go and that he is forever going to be chasing these emotions and people yet still remain lost. By the end of the album he accepts this and while he isn’t truly there, he can still feel
            their emotions and remembers the joy they had. He wants them to move on. This is something that resonates with me to this very day and is one of the more in-depth albums messages I’ve seen.

        </p>
        <p> When we start looking at the instrumentals and production, you have an amazing album that takes influences from japanese rock music and a little bit of synth-pop. The melodies and his voice are truly amazing, even if you don’t speak japanese
            you can feel the emotions through it. I enjoy this album quite often. Even if it is playing it on shuffle or it is appearing in a playlist, it is something that I rarely skip.

        <p>This is a 12-track album from the interesting alternative artist Hobo Johnson. This album is something that is quite the genre-bending record. Hobo Johnson was an artist that had his big-break after a spoken-word song he wrote won an internet
            contest. While it really got popular because of its goofy and weirdly heart-warming lyrics, this album showed he could truly do more than that. His first album, The Rise of Hobo Johnson, is one that I don’t really enjoy that much. While
            it was unique, there were too many ideas being tossed around and it really felt like a giant mess. This album truly is all those ideas organized but still messy. It’s hard to say what genre this album is. Many say alternative rock mixed
            with spoken word. There are clear cut rap and folk influences on it too.
        </p>
        <p>The title “The Fall of Hobo Johnson” is an interesting one because this is once again quite the opposite. This is by far his best album ever and felt like the rise of this artist. Oddly, his next two albums would basically be the “fall” of
            Johnson. He kinda predicted what would happen after this and I’m sure that the title of this album was a joke or nod at the fact that many one hit wonders drop their sophomore albums and lose all their originality in it. This album truly
            sees Johnson going back and forth between his dreams and then a realist mindset setting in. He realizes that while his fame started bringing his goals higher and higher, they are pretty unachievable. Songs such as “All in My Head” and
            “Sorry, My Dear” sees him essentially have emotional breakdowns in front of the microphone, but lyrically they are just amazing songs.
        </p>
        <p>The production of this album is one of my favourite ones from all of alternative music. It truly does feel like every song has its own vibe and direction but it all remains under the same project. They feel so apart but together by the end
            of the album. Some songs may have heavy processing on his voice, specifically ones where Johnson is very distraught. Other songs will be very stripped back with maybe just a piano and some drums in the mix. Ever since I listened to this
            album years ago, it has remained one of my favourites of all-time. With some of the songs like “Mover Awayer” and “I Want a Dog” being in my top 20 songs for the past few years.

        <p>A 16-track masterpiece from the greatest-rapper of all time, Kendrick Lamar. While many may say that his album before this is the best, this one really takes a more interesting alternative take to rap than one would initially expect. This
            is his third ever album and he is one of the only artists I could say has really grown over his first three albums. Some typically fall off by album 3 but Kendrick is simply on a different level. This is my favourite hip-hop album of all-time
            and favourite album in general. I’ve been listening to it for years and it has never lost it’s touch with me. This album really has more apparent jazz, soul and funk influences than all of his other albums.
        </p>
        <p>The title of this album is one that Kendrick says he wants to have a provoking meaning to. He says that a butterfly is a beautiful thing and that pimp is a word used with such aggression. It’s two things seen in the public eye as complete
            polar opposites, but he combines them in order to convey that he is a celebrity using his fame for good. The songs go through the topics of fame, hate, depression, violence, race and politics. This album was heavily inspired by Lamar’s
            trip to South African in 2014, the year before this album was released. Songs such as “King Kunta” and “The Blacker the Berry” are immensely well crafted songs that are personally favourites.
        </p>
        <p> I could go on and on about this album but I’ll try to contain it. Kendrick is my favourite artist ever and this album cemented it. The interludes are flawless and the poem that ties into every song and then presents itself in entirety at the
            end is something that I love. The production on the album is smooth and jazzy but still rigid and has that edge Kendrick is used to. The instruments include everything from drums, trumpets and all sorts of jazzy instruments. Even with
            all those different instruments, he manages to make insanely good beats that even to this day, they are recognizable and have influenced many other rap artists to this day.
