            Video Game Rankings

    <p> On this page I’ll be discussing my top video-games of all time. This is something that I’ve always enjoyed. Video Games are such unique games that can manage to capture interactive stories in a way that is barely seen in other forms of media.
        I’ve always played games and watched video game playthroughs of interesting games that I'd suspected I would enjoy. In this I won’t be really counting basic multiplayer games that come out every year such as NBA 2K and Call of Duty. I’m more
        into story driven games anyways.
    </p>
    <p>As usual I’ll be ranking within categories. For each game I’ll be scoring their Gameplay, Story, Graphics and Overall Enjoyment, except for the honorable mention. It’ll be done out of 100 as usual. I sadly will not count games I’ve never finished
        but I love. So stuff like Ghost of Tsushima and Red Dead Redemption 2 will not be on this list cause I still haven’t finished them, even though I hold both of them in very high regard. I will not be counting games I’ve seen someone play, since
        I want to technically have an experience as a player myself.
    </p>

        <h2> Honorable Mention: God of War 4 (2018)

        <p>This game technically is more of a reboot or a different telling of the god of war story. You don’t need to play the past games in order to get to this one. New and old fans alike will enjoy this game so much. The gameplay was insanely good.
            The story is one of the best in recent years and has led to so much hype for the sequel to come, which is coming out later this year. Kratos is such a good character and the way he is voiced and designed is top-notch. The graphics were
            groundbreaking at the time but sadly not enough for me to put it on this list. It’s a great game but I personally didn’t enjoy it as much as others, and it took me a while to finish. I stopped a couple times before continuing.

        <p>This is a choice-based adventure game released in 2018. It features a story about a world in the future with androids. Bringing up many interesting questions and philosophical situations relating to the humanity of it all, this game manages
            to have one of the most unique stories in recent years. The development team, Quantic Dream, is known for their great games in this same genre. This specific game is their best of all time. It is truly a game where your choice matters
            and the different branches and endings there are ridiculous. The graphics for this game, even the audio, was so advanced at the time. The team essentially built its own engine for it to run on and it was definitely worth all of that work.
        </p>
        <p>While the gameplay is pretty different from other games, it’s still something that is so unique and groundbreaking for it’s genre that it is top tier in itself. Small decisions later affect major instances down the road. It feels like an interactive
            movie and that is exactly what the game director intended for it to feel like. I loved replaying this game around like 4 times just to see all of the drastically different choices I could make. A perfect example of choice-based gameplay
            and the ability to have an amazing story told mostly in motion-capture.

        <p>This is an action-adventure game from Kojima Productions, who are famously known for their work on Metal Gear Solid. This is their first game after leaving their previous owners and becoming their own independent studio. The story is quite
            confusing to explain but it has to do with connecting the world back together and living in a world where there are looming ghosts of people basically that are in limbo between the world and heaven. The event that caused this was called
            the “Death Stranding”. The player works as a delivery man that helps connect all of these together. While some dislike the game because of extending walking periods, I say its one of the best of all time. Everything can affect the state
            of your package and terrain mechanics are unique. You can fall if you walk in rocks that are too rough and wet, lose balance in the middle of rushing water and swimming can be affected by nearly everything that is in the water.
        </p>
        <p>The graphics of this game are second to none and still hold up to this very day. Even going back and playing it, it is one of the most graphically beautiful games of all time. The engine it’s made on, Decima, is the best ever. Gameplay can
            be a little bit annoying at times but overall it really adds to the very important mechanics of the game. It immerses the player in it’s world and takes advantage of all of the newest technology available, at that time, to game developers.
            The story is confusing at first but by the end it truly felt like a cinematic experience.

        <p>This is an action RPG that was developed by Guerrilla Games. This is by far my favourite game of all time and has been since it’s initial release. The engine, Decima, was built specifically for this game and revolutionized the gaming industry.
            It was one of the first games to include 4K built into the base engine. It is a game about a dystopian world where our current world is of the past. There was a mass extinction event that caused the world to be reverted back into the bronze
            age. Most animals were replaced by robotic ones but no one remembers who put them there. Over the time they’ve gotten increasingly corrupt and aggressive. The player must explore the world to help prevent this and find out the truth about
            how this world came about
        </p>
        <p>The mechanics of this game were crazy good. The skill tree offers different options to tackle the game. Every side mission helps you in the end game. The different machines you tame come with all sorts of different advantages. Arrow types
            and armor types are all given specific benefits that help you at different points of the game. The graphics are groundbreaking and stunning to look at. While it doesn’t look as beautiful as it did back then, it is still great. I would
            stay up for countless nights in order to finish the game. It is so rewarding to finish everything and it remains the only game I've done 100% everything in. It is truly perfect in my eyes.
